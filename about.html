        <h1>our mission</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">zine.cafe is a community rooted in the radical history of zines as tools for resistance. 
            we amplify counter-narratives through youth-driven programming, independent publishing, and critical pedagogy.

                incorporated visual arts, social justice, and social emotional learning standards. this project was funded by the 
                <a href="https://www.optimizemi.org/sic">optiMize Social Innovation Challenge</a> in 2024. </p>
